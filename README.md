A few scripts for steering a drone with a custom RCU

This is a loosly accumulated collection of arduino and python code for using an ESP32, a MPU6050, a small joystick and a BME180 as an RCU for a Tello Drone. 
It is not documented, reasonably tested or secure. 
Use it however you want, I take no responsibility
